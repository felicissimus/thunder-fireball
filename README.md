# thunder-fireball
This repository contains the sources to create two drivers:

fireball.x and fireball-MDET.x

This driver reads and interpolates all the multi-center interections and 
builds the tight-binding Hamiltonian.  This executable also performs 
molecular dyanamics and is the fully functional version of the FIREBALL 
technology.
